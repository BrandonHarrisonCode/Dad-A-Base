# The Dad-A-Base

Where does a software engineer keep all of his dad jokes? In the Dad-A-Base, of course.

For more jokes that make you go "that was kind of amusing," see: [https://dad-a-base.online/](https://dad-a-base.online/)

# Motivation

This is website tells random dad jokes that are stored in the Dad-A-Base that I made during quarantine. There's really not much more to it than that. 

This is the frontend portion of the project. For the backend and Dad-A-Base itself see [this repository](https://github.com/BrandonHarrisonCode/Dad-A-Base-API).

# Tech/framework used

The Dad-A-Base was built with:
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (for the frontend)
* [Gatsby Dimension](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension) / [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) (for the design template)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (for hosting)
