# The Dad-A-Base

Where does a software engineer keep all of his dad jokes? In the Dad-A-Base, of course.

This site collates and delivers a random dad joke whenever you ask for one.

# Motivation

This is website tells random dad jokes that are stored in the Dad-A-Base that I made during quarantine. I was running out of jokes to tell to my girlfriend to annoy her, so I wanted to make sure I over-engineered a solution to permenantly solve the problem.

This is the frontend portion of the project. For the backend and Dad-A-Base itself see [this repository](https://github.com/BrandonHarrisonCode/Dad-A-Base-API).
